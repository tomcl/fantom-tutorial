This is a tutorial for Fantom suitable for somone familiar with OO languages who wants a clearer guide to Fantom's features than is found in the standard documentation.

It is NOT a guide to all of Fantom's syntax, which can be picked up from the Fantom standard documentation.

# Editing the source


The guide is written as a single file in lyx source that contains tikz pictures. It can be exported as latex or PDf using Lyx 2.1 +. An uptodate PDF export will always be kept with the source.

Lyx is a neat wysiwym editor that encapsulates latex in a readable form. Lyx source can be edited similarly to a word processor document with the big advantage that page layout, cross references, styles, are all handles properly. Think of it as a sweet spot compromise between wysiwyg word processor formats and impossible to read without compiling macro-based latex.

For those not currently using latex or tex, Lyx 2.1 can be downloaded standalone from www.lyx.org, it will download all necessary dependencies. On Windows MikTex is a better base distribution than Texlive unless you want a very big download - miktex will download new packages as needed on demand (you should set the download setting to automatic).

Lyx has a "compare" option that will merge documents nicely if needed, and also integrates with git repositories. If anyone wishes to correct/add to this document then just create a branch and do so - I will merge it back in (I've not used git before so i only imagine this will work in an obvious way!).
